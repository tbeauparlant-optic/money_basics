<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Poverty: </b>measured in the United States by comparing an individual or family’s income to a set</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">poverty threshold (the minimum amount of income needed to cover basic needs). People whose</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">income falls under this threshold are considered poor.</span><span class="s2">8</span><span class="s1"> However, many other factors go into</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">defining poverty, including geographic location, resources such as childcare or financial assets,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">a state’s minimum wage and public benefits, multigenerational or cyclical poverty, demographics</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">such as race/ethnicity, gender, ability, migrant status, veteran status, and more. These factors</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">can make it difficult for people to experience <b>economic mobility </b>– improving an individual or</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">family’s economic status over a lifetime or over generations. The U.S. is a wealthy country, yet</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">millions of Americans remain in poverty or on the brink of poverty. In 2019, an estimated 34 million</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Americans lived in poverty.</span><span class="s2">9</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Economic insecurity: </b>a lack of a stable income or confidence in maintaining an adequate</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">standard of living, often caused by unemployment or low-wage jobs.</span><span class="s2">10</span><span class="s1"> Economic insecurity can</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">result in debt, food insecurity, and housing insecurity and/or homelessness.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Economic well-being: </b>defined as having <i>present </i>and <i>future</i> financial security. Present financial</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">security means individuals or families can meet their basic needs and have control over their daily</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">finances. Future economic security means that individuals or families have the ability to absorb</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">financial shocks or unexpected expenses, build assets, and maintain an adequate income during</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">their lifetime.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Economic inequality: </b>measured as the gaps in income and wealth between rich and poor</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">households. <i>Income inequality </i>is how unevenly income is distributed between individuals, groups,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">populations, social classes, or countries. In the United States, income inequality has increased</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">since the 1980s as the wealthiest Americans’ incomes continue to grow, the middle class shrinks,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">and lower-income families’ incomes remain stagnant. A very small percentage of Americans take</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">home a significant amount of the country’s total income, while the share held by lower-income</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">families is decreasing. Similar to income inequality, there is significant <i>wealth inequality</i><b> </b>in the</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">United States, where a tiny portion of the population holds nearly all of the country’s wealth, while</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">middle and working class folks hold very little.</span><span class="s2">12</span><span class="s1"> Economic inequality is a contributing factor to</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">social class and social division based on factors such as income, wealth, education level, gender,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">race/ethnicity, occupation, or power.</span><span class="s2">13</span><span class="s1"> Many economists believe that growing income and wealth</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">inequality will affect the economic mobility and opportunity for lower-income groups, as well as</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">less political influence and the division of populations based on income/class.</span><span class="s2">14</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Classism: </b>differential treatment based on social class or perceived social class.</span><span class="s2">15</span><span class="s1"> Classism is the</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">systematic oppression of working-class people to strengthen the power and privilege of the</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">dominant, wealthy class. In classist societies, characteristics of worth and ability are assigned to</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">individuals and groups based on their social class.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Intersectionality: </b>the many systems of oppression in our society (racism, sexism, classism,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia) simultaneously overlap and interlock – they are</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">intersectional. Civil rights scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined this term in 1989, wrote: </span><span class="s3">“</span><span class="s1">It’s</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">basically a lens, a prism, for seeing the way in which various forms of inequality often operate</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">together and exacerbate each other. We tend to talk about race inequality as separate from</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">inequality based on gender, class, sexuality or immigrant status. What’s often missing is how</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">some people are subject to all of these, and the experience is not just the sum of its parts.”</span><span class="s2">16</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Poverty cannot be separated from the other structural inequalities that shape society, such as</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">discrimination formed along the lines of gender and sexuality, race or ethnicity, nationality,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">migration status, religion, or disability. The effect of systemic racism on economic mobility among</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">People of Color is an example of how the structures and policies that uphold racism and classism</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">intersect. Systemic racism in the United States has been, and continues to be, a barrier to</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">economic mobility and building generational wealth for BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Color) communities.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Systemic racism: </b>racism that has been embedded in the institutions and laws of a society, and</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">is found in American housing, employment, education, health care, and criminal justice systems.</span><span class="s2">17</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">For example, racist housing policies after the Great Depression and during the housing boom of</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">the 1950s and 1960s allowed for the creation of generational wealth for White Americans, while</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">denying African Americans the same opportunities to build and pass on assets. Because of this,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">the average White family holds almost eight times the wealth of the average Black family.</span><span class="s2">18</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Redlining</b> is a key example of racist housing policies that affect economic stability today. In the</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">1930s, the government marked neighborhoods with high minority populations in red and refused</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">to provide mortgages to residents in these areas; while at the same time subsidizing suburban</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">homes for White families. Without access to federally-insured mortgages, BIPOC families were</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">unable to purchase homes and build equity or were forced into predatory and abusive loans.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">19 </span><span class="s1">In Portland, Oregon, systemic racism in housing and city planning excluded communities of color</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">from homeownership and wealth-building, denied them access to educational resources, jobs,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">healthcare and more, and displaced many families from their homes.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">This displacement</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">continues today due to rising prices and gentrification of historically Black neighborhoods. We</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">acknowledge that systemic racism impacts the opportunities, resources, and economic well-being</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">of many in our community. To those in our community who have experienced the pain of racism,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">we stand in solidarity with you.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Privilege: </b>the advantages that an individual receives from belonging to a certain social identity</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">group; the opposite of belonging to groups that are systematically and simultaneously</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">oppressed.</span><span class="s2">23</span><span class="s1"> White privilege refers to the unearned power that White people experience simply</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">because they are White, in which they will never experience racism or other forms of</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">discrimination because of the color of their skin. In addition to White privilege, one can have male</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">privilege, heterosexual privilege, cisgender privilege, able-bodied privilege, class or wealth</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">privilege, and more. If you are privileged in certain ways, it does not mean that you have never</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">faced hardships in your life. Rather, having privilege means that you are not being discriminated</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">against in a number of ways because of your social identity or identities. If you have privilege, you</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">have benefited from it whether you wanted to or not. If you have lived experiences with mental</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">health and/or addiction issues and are on your journey to recovery, you have likely experienced</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">significant pain and struggle and it is a privilege<i> </i>to <i>not</i> live with these challenges.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Social justice: </b>justice and fairness as it manifests in society -- in education, healthcare,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">employment, housing, and in the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges.</span><span class="s2">24</span><span class="s1"> Social</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">justice includes human rights, access to resources, political participation, and equity. Racial and</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">gender equity, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmental justice are examples of social justice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Equity:</b> involves understanding the barriers or privileges afforded to different groups, how these</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">create different circumstances and needs, and how resources and opportunities should be</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">allocated in different ways (because of these different circumstances) to create equal outcomes</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">for all in the community. This is different from <b>equality</b>, in which all groups are given the same</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">resources and opportunities, regardless of circumstances or needs.</span><span class="s2">25</span></p>
